Bolt now has full support for Photon's industry proven matchmaking and global relay 
network.

This sample shows how you can start a Bolt server using Photon, and how to connect 
clients to it using the same API you'd use for Bolt on LAN.

Before proceeding, please register and create an App ID on 
http://www.photonengine.com/. You'll need to fill the App ID on 
Window/Bolt/Settings, under the Photon category.

Use the provided "PhotonMenu" scene as the starting point, and take a look at the 
BoltPhotonInit.cs script.
