This folder contains samples that highlight the most important Bolt features. The following
samples are included:

- PhotonCloud: how to init Bolt to work on top of Photon Cloud or custom hosted 
Photon servers (readme.txt inside the folder).
- ClickToMove: a simple, server-authoritative example for moving a character
by clicking on terrain;
- ThirdPersonCharacter: multiplayer versions of the Unity TPC demo, both with and without
server authoritative movement;
- AdvancedTutorial: assets and sources for Bolt's advanced tutorial. Complete
instructions found on https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/bolt/current/advanced-tutorials/chapter-1

Any of the gameplay scenes from the included samples can be directly tested from Bolt's
Scenes window (found on Window/Bolt/Scenes) by following the instructions bellow:

1. Make sure the scene is added to Unity's 'Build Settings'.
   If you skip this, Bolt's Scene window won't show any scene.
2. Edit the Player Settings to make sure "Run in Background" is enabled!
   The demos must be able to run in background. If you can't control the clients,
   or don't see coordinated movement, "Run in Background" is probably not set.
3. Open 'Window/Bolt/Scenes' and click 'Debug Start' to start any of the samples.
   This will build and run the demo in Editor and (at least) 1 client.
